gtnh.quest226.name=See the unseen
gtnh.quest226.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6. Like the infused shards you found. You noticed that those shards start to vibrate when you bring them next to something that is made of the respective aspect. Maybe you can create a device to actually "scan" items, and reveal their compounds? This could be very useful later on.

#Quest_227.Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.name=Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.desc=Indeed, the idea with the bookshelf did work. Now you need a nice table to do some research on, and probably something to infuse items with vis while crafting. Maybe you should try to smite a table with your wand.

gtnh.quest229.desc=This whole place here is filled with magic. No matter where you look at, it's just everywhere. You wonder what happens to regular stone if it's exposed to large amounts of magic for such a long time. Maybe it's time to go mining?

#Quest_230.Your first wand
gtnh.quest230.name=Your first wand
gtnh.quest230.desc=You are sure that this place will give you all the answers you are looking for! To continue, you need something to handle the magic energy called "vis". Guess it's time to craft your first wand.

gtnh.quest231.name=Tome of knowledge
gtnh.quest231.desc=All the things you've discovered so far, you need to write them down. But you are lazy, and you have a wand, so why not try a magical way to "write down" your research? You wonder if you could enchant a book with your wand, so that it will keep track of your progress... You should try that on a bookshelf!

#Quest_232.Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.name=Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.desc=Your wand does a great job in storing and releasing vis as you please. However, those iron caps are... Weak. If you don't pay enough attention to it, it might hurt the node. Maybe you should try to improve it with caps made out of a more valuable material. Like.. gold, perhaps?

#Quest_233.Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.name=Getting shards

#Quest_235.Better screws
gtnh.quest235.name=Better screws
gtnh.quest235.desc=Unfortunately, your aluminium screws don't work with the greatwood rod. Somehow, the wood seems to repel the material. Luckily, you already have a blast furnace, so you can get a better material than aluminium.

#Quest_236.A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.name=A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.desc=The naga scales are weak, they can only hold a very limited amount of vis. You need a better, more powerful component to store vis in your wand. You've heard rumors about an evil wizard in the Twilight Forest. Maybe he has... something... that can be used?

#Quest_237."Stores 50 vis" wand
gtnh.quest237.name="Stores 50 vis" wand
gtnh.quest237.desc=Now combine your new wand, and be more powerful than before! You have a feeling, that this new wand will come in handy very soon(tm).

#Quest_238.Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.name=Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.desc=Your arcane table does a great job with infusing primal vis into items while crafting. However, you feel that there must be more. What if you could infuse items with all kinds of magic aspects? The possibilities are endless...

gtnh.quest245.name=The choice...
gtnh.quest245.desc=By now, you should've collected a few (or a lot) of locations for aura nodes to get vis from.

#Quest_252.This is the end...
gtnh.quest252.name=This is the end...
gtnh.quest252.desc=...of your apprenticeship. You have mastered all 6 primal aspects, you mastered the weak and strong infusion of essentia and vis, and you've already made your adept wand.

#Quest_253.Turning liquids into essentia
gtnh.quest253.name=Turning liquids into essentia
gtnh.quest253.desc=What a simple idea. So many people wasted tons of buckets just to get aqua from water, or sano from milk. Why didn't they just dissolve the liquid itself? Stupid ones...

#Quest_254.Essentia filtering
gtnh.quest254.name=Essentia filtering
gtnh.quest254.desc=This nifty little device will filter out essentia. Once it has received a single unit of any type, it will only accept this type until it is completely empty. How convenient. You can place more than one on top of an alchemical furnace.

gtnh.quest255.desc=And lava! It's an excellent magical heat source.

#Quest_256.Not coal
gtnh.quest256.name=Not coal
gtnh.quest256.desc=Way better. To be fair, it's a waste to use coal itself, but it also works with charcoal and lignite dust. And it speeds up the dissolving of items in an alchemical furnace.

gtnh.quest257.name=Save the squids, we must

gtnh.quest263.name=It doesn't work
gtnh.quest263.desc=I tried to combine the lich bones I had with this new wand rod. The result: A pile of ashes. It crumbled to dust within seconds. I need a better conductor.

gtnh.quest264.name=Obsidian rod

#Quest_265.Creating a better wand
gtnh.quest265.name=Creating a better wand
gtnh.quest265.desc=This greatwood wand is nice, but it can only store 50 vis. Not enough to move nodes. My tries to use silverwood failed, but I've come across other mundane materials that I could use to make a new wand core.

#Quest_266.More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.name=More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.desc=Those stainless steel screws don't work on these rods. Due to the huge amounts of vis those wands can carry, the screws somehow "melt" away. I need a more durable material. I guess I will try titanium next.

#Quest_275.Centi-vis
gtnh.quest275.name=Centi-vis
gtnh.quest275.desc=Many advanced machines require vis in order to do what they're supposed to. But using a wand as some sort of battery to transfer vis from a node to your machine didn't work as expected. What if you could rip open a node?

#Quest_276.Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.name=Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.desc=You probably have a nice collection of bookmarked nodes. But running around to recharge your wand(s) isn't really the way an adept thaumaturge should get his required vis. Moving nodes is not that hard, but without doubt, you need something to protect them from each other.

gtnh.quest277.name=Automated wand-recharge
gtnh.quest277.desc=So you found a way to gather nodes now. What about automated wand recharge? Wouldn't that be extremely convenient?

gtnh.quest287.name=What could possibly go wrong?
gtnh.quest287.desc=256 essentia in one block! Now that is what I call storage. Does make weird sounds, but I guess it's nothing special...

#Quest_288.Let's try this
gtnh.quest288.name=Let's try this

gtnh.quest307.desc=The pearl you've found has some interesting effects on you. Not only are the voices almost gone, somehow it has also expanded your perception. You can "feel" the magic around you. This is definitely worth some further investigation.

#Quest_308.The final goal
gtnh.quest308.name=The final goal
gtnh.quest308.desc=Thanks to your help I have managed to create the ultimate energy source: An encased wormhole that drains energy from a synthesized pocket universe, to the point when it reaches heat death. I have no use for it, so you may have it. Thank you for making my dream come true!

#Quest_309.Shards of opposite worlds
gtnh.quest309.name=Shards of opposite worlds
gtnh.quest309.desc=This morning, you just wanted to facepalm yourself to death. During your past journeys, you have already seen strangely colored shards. But unlike the primal shards you use every day, these seem to contain the raw essence of their dimension. Heaven and Hell... so to speak. Two opposite worlds.

gtnh.quest324.name=Unleashed the power
gtnh.quest324.desc=To make use of your tool to its full extent, you'll have to unleash its hidden power. This is not an easy task; But it's well worth the effort!

gtnh.quest325.name=Unleashed the power
gtnh.quest325.desc=To make use of your tool to its full extent, you'll have to unleash its hidden power. This is not an easy task; But it's well worth the effort!

gtnh.quest331.name=Why walk...
gtnh.quest331.desc=...when you can teleport? This little device allows you to teleport around almost for free. Is it cheaty? Is it OP? Nope, it's a celestial gateway!

#Quest_332.Brewers start
gtnh.quest332.name=Brewers start
gtnh.quest332.desc=In order to get started with your basic witchery needs, you need a witches oven. It's used to get the most basic ingredients for your recipes: Fumes.

#Quest_333.Offerings
gtnh.quest333.name=Offerings
gtnh.quest333.desc=For all your offering needs. And of course, it looks fancy!

#Quest_334.A cauldron?
gtnh.quest334.name=A cauldron?

#Quest_335.Don't touch the needle!
gtnh.quest335.name=Don't touch the needle!
gtnh.quest335.desc=While having not many recipes by itself, the few it has are rather important for your further witchery progression.

#Quest_336.Probably usable for soup
gtnh.quest336.name=Probably usable for soup
gtnh.quest336.desc=But its main purpose is to brew potions and infusions.

#Quest_337.Don't shake it too much
gtnh.quest337.name=Don't shake it too much
gtnh.quest337.desc=Unlike nitroglycerin, this stuff doesn't explode. But you still shouldn't shake it too much...

#Quest_338.Getting basic fumes
gtnh.quest338.name=Getting basic fumes
gtnh.quest338.desc=Fume extraction is an essential thing to do, and you'll need a lot of those on your journey.

#Quest_339.Circle magic
gtnh.quest339.name=Circle magic
gtnh.quest339.desc=For circle magic, you need... a circle, obviously. There are 4 types of chalk you can use, and you'll need all of them to proceed.

#Quest_340.Portable power source
gtnh.quest340.name=Portable power source
gtnh.quest340.desc=By infusing a stone with fiery magic you can create an "Attuned Stone". These stones can be used to link non-magical devices to the magical currents present...

#Quest_341.Flying OINKment
gtnh.quest341.name=Flying OINKment
gtnh.quest341.desc=You tried, it doesn't fly. And it also doesn't make any OINK sounds, sadly. But there might be some use for it...

#Quest_342.Nimbus 1999
gtnh.quest342.name=Nimbus 1999
gtnh.quest342.desc=Not as good as its successor, the 2000'ish model, but still "somehow" useful...

#Quest_343.Bloodlust: Refined evil
gtnh.quest343.name=Bloodlust: Refined evil
gtnh.quest343.desc=Refined good was out of stock, sorry.

#Quest_344.Bloodlust: Witches hand
gtnh.quest344.name=Bloodlust: Witches hand

gtnh.quest345.desc=Who needs an antidote?

#Quest_346.Bloodlust: Taglock kits
gtnh.quest346.name=Bloodlust: Taglock kits
gtnh.quest346.desc=Get a death protection poppet and get a stack of taglock kits. For all your trolling needs.

#Quest_347.Bloodlust: Drop of luck
gtnh.quest347.name=Bloodlust: Drop of luck
gtnh.quest347.desc=Hard to get, even with that quest. But less of a grind...

#Quest_348.Bloodlust: "Cain" sword
gtnh.quest348.name=Bloodlust: "Cain" sword
gtnh.quest348.desc=Serves 2 purposes: Style. And... ah, yeah... Something useful for vampires.

#Quest_349.Be a vampire; Like a sir
gtnh.quest349.name=Be a vampire; Like a sir
gtnh.quest349.desc=Sometimes it can be troublesome to get fancy clothing. However, if you prove yourself worthy, you get a set for free.

#Quest_350.A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.name=A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.desc=Ok, I think I have everything I need to assemble the device. Can you assist me with some additional materials? I need to update most of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged most of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.\n\nMost of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.\n\nGood lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?\n\nDo you see that pile of chrome over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?\n\nIt seems, that the stabilizers need... stabilizing... But I'm out of field generators. Can you help me with this?

#Quest_351.Hello there
gtnh.quest351.name=Hello there
gtnh.quest351.desc=I've observed your pathway, and I have to say, I'm impressed. I might need your help soon, on a big project of mine.

#Quest_352.Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.name=Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.desc=If only I could harness it... Well, hi there my friend. I need your help with a project of mine. I want to create an immense power source, but I have a few problems that I need to solve first. Will you help me? You will be rewarded.

#Quest_353.A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.name=A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.desc=I need to open a wormhole. But for that, I need an immense gravitational field. One like those created upon the death of a star. But I can't really "kill" a sun for this. I need to compress matter somehow... \nBut... How?

#Quest_354.Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.name=Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.desc=Of course! The matter condenser! How come I didn't think of that?

#Quest_355.I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.name=I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.desc=Opening the wormhole is one thing, but I need to stabilize it, so it doesn't harm anything. I guess I need something made of crystal. Why? Because I like it fancy. Find me a crystal-based, transparent material with immense power, would you?

#Quest_356.Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.name=Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.desc=What in the world is this? This is amazing! I need more of these! They will be an amazing containment material for the wormhole!

#Quest_357.I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.name=I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.desc=What... I work a lot! So get me some food please.

#Quest_358.It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.name=It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.desc=Given the fact that I will be able to craft this device, it needs some kind of "plug" to get the power out. I need something to conduct immense amounts of power. I thought about superconductors, but they don't fit with the crystal casing material I have in mind. I need 2 different crystals, one for positive and one for negative charge.

#Quest_359.Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.name=Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.desc=Really? A red and blue crystal? How awesome is that! I think I will need 8 of each color, just to be sure.

#Quest_360.A casing
gtnh.quest360.name=A casing
gtnh.quest360.desc=I need something for the outer shell. Again, a crystal-based material would be best, because I like it shiny. I tested all crystals we know and none of them meet the requirements. I heard you have access to the space? Can you try to find a suitable material while you're out there?

#Quest_361.Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.name=Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.desc=Yes. Yes! That's it! Bring me more of this stuff! I probably need a lot of it...

#Quest_362.Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.name=Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.desc=What is this? Draconium dust? I wonder if I could use this for something...

#Quest_363.The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.name=The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.desc=Hey my friend. I got your sample, and I have to say, I'm amazed. This material has a lot of potential, but it's useless at the moment. I have an idea how to turn this into something useful, but I need you to help me with a few problems first.\n\nI need a good handful of that stuff for my research. Please get me some.

#Quest_364.A hull
gtnh.quest364.name=A hull
gtnh.quest364.desc=First things first, we need a hull. I played around with your sample, and it seems that it reacts with every known material. It even attacks Iridium! It's completely harmless if it's in a box that is open, but as soon as I try to enclose it in something, poof. It breaks free. We need something stronger than iridium my friend.

#Quest_365.Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.name=Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.desc=Now look at this. This stuff is incredibly dense. Maybe this material will be sufficiently strong?\n\nThis looks promising. Send me some samples, and I will try my luck.

#Quest_366.Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.name=Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.desc=This place is interesting. Maybe I should try to find new materials here...

#Quest_367.Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.name=Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.desc=Heh, neutronium. I didn't even know such a thing really exists. Unfortunately, the draconium dust was enclosed for... 5 seconds? But, it was a small success. \n\nOk let's travel to some planets and moons and look for the new material. I think we have to fly very far away for it.

#Quest_368.Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.name=Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.desc=This doesn't seem to be dense, but it's a material you haven't seen before. Maybe this could be the solution?\n\nBlack what? Huh, interesting. Send me some samples, I want to analyse it.

#Quest_369.We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.name=We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.desc=Surprisingly, this material is able to contain the draconium dust. It could be the radiation. Good job my friend!

#Quest_370.Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.name=Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.desc=I've created a first sample of what I shall call "Draconium Dust core". Not quite the result I expected to be honest, but see for yourself.

#Quest_371.We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.name=We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.desc=The problem is, that the immense power of this dust is released all at once. We need something to control the vast amount of energies. I noticed that the dust starts to glow when it gets near an aura node. Maybe Thaumaturgy has the solution?

#Quest_372.The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.name=The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.desc=What else could control energies better than a focus of crystallized primal energy? With this little item, it should be possible to control the energies released from the dust.

#Quest_373.Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.name=Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.desc=You haven't heard anything in a while from the technician. You have a feeling that something might have gone terrible wrong, so you went to his place to investigate. What you found was... nothing. A void. It seems that he tried to combine the pearl with the dust. What did he say? The dust reacts to aura nodes? Of course it does. It amplifies the energies by a thousand times. And giving it raw primal energy, good lord, what has he done. May he rest in peace...

#Quest_374.I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.name=I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.desc=I need to continue my research. I still think that this primordial pearl is the key to control the dust, but I'm not sure how. Maybe the pearl is just too strong? I should try to use something that's similar, but less powerful. It reacts to vis, so maybe.. I should try to make a wand focus with that pearl. That way, I could channel vis into the dust without actually combining both.

#Quest_375.An interesting material
gtnh.quest375.name=An interesting material
gtnh.quest375.desc=This metal has quite interesting properties. It seems, that it has absorbed some of the energy that exists in the End. While ender pearls are quite fragile, this metal is a lot more durable. However, the absorbed energy is not enough to teleport things around. But you might find a solution for this.

#Quest_376.Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.name=Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.desc=It's purple, and it smells like rotten eggs. But while staring at this unpleasant fluid, you had an idea. You can't reach the dust directly, but can you actually teleport something in and out the field? Might be worth a try.

#Quest_377.An appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.name=An appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.desc=You've tried a lot, and nothing was quite enough to activate the dust. Until now. You finally found a focus that is able to transmit enough power to cause a heavy reaction with the dust, but not enough to cause problems.

#Quest_378.Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.name=Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.desc=At least for a short period of time. The wand focus is powerful enough to activate the dust, but it will convert back to regular dust as soon as I stop feeding it with vis. If I only could contain it, surround it with a forcefield...

#Quest_379.The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.name=The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.desc=In order to create a forcefield, I need to build myself a containment device. I will use only the best emitters I can afford. I will take no risks here.

#Quest_380.Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.name=Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.desc=The outcome was... interesting. It did not explode, instead, the activated draconium dust generated a counter-field to mine! Unfortunately, the emitters could not stand the reverse energies, and melted. I was able to shut it off quick enough to save the machine casing (At least what's left from it...) And a couple of field generators.

#Quest_381.Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.name=Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.desc=I came to the following conclusion: Draconium dust seems to react nicely with all kinds of magic energy, and seems to repel technology. So I need to find a way to create a forcefield with magic alone. There must be a way...

#Quest_382.A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.name=A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.desc=While node stabilizers are too weak, you found a way to generate a strong containment field, generated by magic itself. You tried to use warded glass, but even the "frozen in spacetime" material could not resist the power of activated draconium dust. You decided to build another device, this time with your newest invention.\n\nThe vortex attenuator is powerful enough to negate even hungry nodes, and it also will be able to contain activated draconium dust.\n\nJust to be sure, I will add some amplifiers to it.

#Quest_383.What the...?
gtnh.quest383.name=What the...?
gtnh.quest383.desc=The device works! It is able to fully contain and separate the draconium dust from everything around it! Unfortunately... It also prevents the vis from passing the barrier, which results in regular draconium dust... In a forcefield...

#Quest_384.Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.name=Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.desc=It is frustrating. Either you are able to contain the dust but can't activate it, or, you activate it and it causes serious damage. Maybe you need to find answers somewhere else.\n\nDraconic... Like... Dragon?

#Quest_385.Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.name=Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.desc=Maybe you where looking for the right things in the wrong place. As this dust obviously origins from dragons, the best thing to do now is to find answers in the dimension of dragons: The End.

#Quest_386.Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.name=Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.desc=These ghosts are weird beings. But, I found this ectoplasm, which, by itself, seems to be pretty useless.

#Quest_387.Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.name=Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.desc=By a random guess of yours, you combined molten ender pearls and a few more of these shards with an empty gem, and it turned blue. It is pulsating with power. You tried to use it on your containment device, and it seems to be able to bypass the force field, while keeping it intact that the same time. Sadly, it doesn't have enough power to let vis pass through. Maybe you can even further increase the gems power?

#Quest_388.Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.name=Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.desc=While the normal world is based on vis and primal energy, the End seems to be quite different. This arcane shard is the crystallized form of this energy, just like the primal shards that you used so many times in the past. By pure randomness, you discovered that it reacts with the metal you've found.

#Quest_389.Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.name=Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.desc=Don't you hate it to manually compress all those tiny piles? Let's automate this process! A combination of a typefilter, a chest buffer (super buffer in HV) and a packager frees you from that annoying task. The chestbuffer can hold up to 9 tiny piles and the super buffer can hold all your tiny dusts and you can set its mode with a screwdriver on the output side. Set it to 9 and let the packager handle the rest.

#Quest_390.Balanced thaumium
gtnh.quest390.name=Balanced thaumium
gtnh.quest390.desc=This new metal is quite cheap, and has an awesome conductivity towards all 6 primal aspects. Regarding the capsule, I'd say it is a superconductor for vis. I think I can finally assemble the final frame.

#Quest_391.Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.name=Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.desc=The machine is working pretty well, but it's tedious to fill in the reagents manually. But you have an idea, you could use a few basic components to fully automate the process.\n\nYou can use robot arms and conveyor belts to automate the input and output.\n\nObviously, you need to power the machines. A solar panel will do just fine.\n\nIn order to automate the catalyst, you need a few things. One golem will gather basic materials, while the second one will hunt creepers and ghasts for the more valuable ingredients.\n\nYou found a way to re-use the singularity, so you only need to get some sand. Luckily, the golem that works on the catalyst will be able to get glass too. He just needs a little additional motivation.\n\nYour golems need light, obviously. Also, it would be nice if there are some signal lamps that indicate the status of the process. Would it not?

#Quest_392.Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.name=Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.desc=You are sure that you've just discovered the solution for your containment problem. This gem happily transmits vis on request, while keeping the containment field intact. What a great day!

#Quest_393.You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.name=You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.desc=Now that you are able to contain the activated draconium dust for an infinite amount of time, you where able to assure the energy it releases. The readings are incredible. You have never seen such a power before. The only problem is, the machinery required to keep the dust in this state is too large to use it for crafting.\n\nYou noticed something that might help: The dust reacts to vis, but it needs a lot of it, therefore you require the animation focus. If you could find a catalyst, that you can mix the dust with, you could make the dust react with the vis from its surroundings instead of a direct beam.

#Quest_394.A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.name=A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.desc=That's it. This catalyst contains all primal energies in a quite different form, a lot weaker than any node. However, in combination with the draconium dust, it amplifies the vis that's around it, which leads to a permanent activation. It still needs to be contained, but you don't need the direct vis beam any more.\n\nThe result is a compound, which still emits massive amounts of power, but is less destructive. It still attacks the neutronium, but I think if I can find a capsule-like container that has special properties, I could create a portable version of it.

#Quest_395.Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.name=Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.desc=By combining a dimensional singularity with some glass cylinders and molten gold, I was able to create a miniature containment field within a very small area. Interesting enough, the new draconium blend amplifies the containment field from the inside. Once I fill the blend in the capsule, it immediately "seals" itself. I won't be able to remove or replace the dust any more, but I don't think I have to...\n\n\nThe perfect vessel for massive power!

#Quest_396.The final steps
gtnh.quest396.name=The final steps
gtnh.quest396.desc=Now that I've found a way to stabilize the draconium dust and keep it safe in a small capsule, I just need to make a small container for it, so I can drain the energy on demand. Neutronium will serve very well, but I need a magic conductor. Thaumium works, but gets way too hot and void metal has a bad conductivity. I need to find a magic alloy that is more "balanced" in terms of primal aspects

#Quest_397.Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.name=Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.desc=Using your machine, you can now craft infinite amounts of these cores. And since it would be gruesome to let your golem work just for one single core, you decided to only request cores in a large batch of 16. How nice of you.

#Quest_398.Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.name=Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.desc=Baba Yaga is a witch (or one of a trio of sisters of the same name), who appears as a deformed and/or ferocious-looking elderly woman. She flies around in a mortar and wields a pestle. She dwells deep in the forest, in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs, with a fence decorated with human skulls. Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter or seek her out.

#Quest_399.Kill Horned Huntsman

Chips with higher priority value will receive items first until the inventory is full then will be sent to other inventories with valid filters and remaining space.\n\n-Dynamic item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network that match items inside the dynamic item responder connected inventory. This chip has to be in the same interface pipe as the item responder chip in order to work. Priority rules apply here as well. \n\n-Item overflow responder works exactly the same as the item responder chip, however it only accepts items that cannot go to an item responder chip, dynamic item responder chip, or item terminator chip. \n\n-Item terminator chip works as a backup for responder chips.\n\n-Item broadcaster chip will show you the inventory connected to the routed request pipe on the pipe network and can be used to retrieve items from it. They can also extract for wich side you configure them. \n\n-Item stock keeper chip will constantly check the network for items and pull them to its pipe. If the chip is set to pull when empty, it will only pull if the inventory next to it is empty, otherwise it will pull when there are less items in the inventory than configured in the chip.\n\n-Item crafting chips craft things. \n\n-Item crafting extension chips are placed inside the item crafting chips.

Next to it add as much drawers as you want, and make sure they are touching each other or the controller.\n\nThe next step is to connect a routed interface pipe to your drawer controller. Take the item responder chip and configure it to filter mode: blacklist (this will allow you to get any items from your system) and add the chip to the routed interface pipe by right clicking on it. Don't forget the dynamic item responder.\n\nIn order to allow your system to be able to see items you need to add the item broadcast chip TO THE SAME ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE WICH IS CONNECTED TO THE DRAWER CONTROLLER.\n\nThe last step is to connect a routed request pipe IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE and right click it to acess the GUI. You can only extract items from it. In order to insert items simply right click them on the drawer controller. \n\nYou can find more complex tutorials on youtube for autocrafting.
